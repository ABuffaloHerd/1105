                <p class="body-text">
                    Streaming is a live broadcast typically over the internet for on demand video or audio content.<br>
                    It can range from people playing games all the way to live podcasts.

                <h2 class="header-subtitle">Focus Points</h2>
                <p>These are the points the resource will focus on.</p>
                
                <h3 class="header-subheading">Copyright</h3>
                <p>
                    DMCA has been a problem affecting the streaming communities and platforms as a whole.
                    Some games now feature a streaming mode that mutes all music so that greedy record companies are unable to strike creators down.<br> 
                    However, the legal system is so flawed and outdated in this aspect that they still find a way.
                </p>
                
            <h3 class="header-subheading">Entrepreneurship</h3>
                <p>
                    Small creators often start out on streaming platforms looking to make a name for themselves. These platforms are often the place where they build their career
                    and community to hopefully become sustainable.<br> However, the platform also reserves the right to dock their pay, which makes it a very fragile source of income for 
                    the creator.
                </p>

                <h3 class="header-subheading">Community</h3>
                <p>
                    Since creators make content, the community consumes this content. In turn the community makes their own jokes and content which the creator
                    can use to make their streams more interesting.
