                    <p class="body-text">
                        Streaming is a live broadcast typically over the internet for on demand video or audio content.
                        It can range from people playing games all the way to live podcasts. Recently, it has been a source of entertainment
                        for the world during lockdown periods and because it is becoming a more mainstream form of media, there are many 
                        positive and negative aspects associated with it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Platforms such as Twitch and YouTube allow creators to present live content i.e. footage that is not recorded and edited beforehand. This has the upside
                        of having unexpected moments recorded and ingrained into internet history forever. On the downside however, small mishaps and slip ups will also be remembered
                        and engraved on the creators name, causing controvery after controversy. An example of this would be the time PewDiePie said the n-word on stream and recieved
                        huge backlash from everybody.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="header-subtitle">Focus Points</h2>
                    <p>These are the points the resource will focus on.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="header-subheading">Copyright</h3>
                    <p>
                        DMCA has been a problem affecting the streaming communities and platforms as a whole.
                        Some games now feature a streaming mode that mutes all music so that greedy record companies are unable to strike creators down.
                        However, the legal system is so flawed and outdated in this aspect that they still find a way. <br>
                        Content piracy is also a prominent problem which steals hard earned work and revenue from creators and brings it to the masses for free.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="header-subheading">Entrepreneurship</h3>
                    <p>
                        Small creators often start out on streaming platforms looking to make a name for themselves. These platforms are often the place where they build their career
                        and community to hopefully become sustainable. However, the platform also reserves the right to dock their pay, which makes it a very fragile source of income for 
                        the creator. <br>
                        This does not just apply to game streams as there are platforms for streaming TV shows and movies. Small studios publish their movies on these platforms as it is 
                        far cheaper than a theatre release. Additionally, the consumer will also find it cheaper and more convenient to watch movies at home rather than having to go 
                        to the local cinema and pay a premium.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="header-subheading">Community</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since creators make content, the community consumes this content. In turn the community makes their own jokes and content which the creator
                        can use to make their streams more interesting. An example of this is the cursed Jerma985 "When the imposter is sus" meme. This is a reflection
                        of what the community is capable of creating.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, on the flip side, communities such as the ones around Pokimane are slighly worse off. One can clearly see this when they are simping hard over 
                        her. This is good for the creator, as she makes heaps of money. However it gives the community a bad public image as the act of doing this is frankly, quite sad.
