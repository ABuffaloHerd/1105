Live streaming is used as a coping mechanism for most viewers of the live streaming category. The method that is used to breakthrough difficult periods of life for viewers was not by relying on the sole streamer to help them get though their problems but by way of finding other people within that streamers community that have experienced similar situations as the viewer that is coping. This allows for those people involved to help and encourage each other to open up and confront there problems they are dealing with.

Another way of connecting in a community using streaming is by the streamer setting up and organizing events that the viewers can get involved in, for example streamers will play party games that allow viewer to participate in which can also incorporate giveaways through competitions of the games they play. You can also get direct interaction by donating and sending a message to the streamer which can be a question or a message of appreciation for the entertainment they provide to the viewer.
Risk: 

Copyright is a frustrating gimmick in most streamers opinion since it’s the most confusing system implemented in live streaming going as far as to say that live streaming platforms don’t know how to handle copyright issues, with Twitch going to halfhearted measures by just muting sections of archived live streams that have copyrighted music leading to the streamers themselves possibly having to go through maybe months and even years of content and deleting them if they have unlicensed music or content throughout the livestream, and with YouTube the copyright issue doesn’t get solved by an administrator at YouTube instead going to the individual or company that put forward the copyright claim leading to that company or individual to take advantage of the system to gain money. So there's really no support when it come to dealing with copyright on live streaming platforms.
