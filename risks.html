                        Copyright is a frustrating gimmick in most streamers opinion since it’s the most confusing system implemented in live streaming going as far as to say that live streaming platforms don’t know how to handle copyright issues, with Twitch going to halfhearted measures by just muting sections of archived live streams that have copyrighted music leading to the streamers themselves possibly having to go through maybe months and even years of content and deleting them if they have unlicensed music or content throughout the livestream, and with YouTube the copyright issue doesn’t get solved by an administrator at YouTube instead going to the individual or company that put forward the copyright claim leading to that company or individual to take advantage of the system to gain money. So there's really no support when it come to dealing with copyright on live streaming platforms.
